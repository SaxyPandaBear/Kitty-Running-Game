<h2>Run Kitty, Run!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Run and jump to get your fortune back one coin at a time.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A single sentence that places the game within a game genre or a hybrid of genres.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story, summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is people who like simple endless side-scrolling games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
    It takes as long as the player can survive, so depending on the randomness of each individual game it could be anywhere between 10 seconds or 10 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Good timing and understanding the hitbox of the hazards will be crucial to a long play time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
